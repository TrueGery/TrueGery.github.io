<h1> Project: DTIS Online </h1>

<p><img id="pic1" src="slider-dtis.png"></p> 

<p>Brand identity development is an essential process for shaping 
how a <b>company</b> is perceived by its target audience. In DTIS 
Online's case, I was involved as a project manager and marketing 
coordinator for it's development in an <i>international</i> market such 
as the one in the United States. </p> 


<h2>Initial Approach</h2> 

<p>Our client was struggling, they wanted more sales, new customers and 
  digital presence. When I first approached this project the concept of diesel
  was foreign to me, I knew it was related to fuel, that's it. I had to do 
  a lot of research just to understand the basics and later to understand 
  their parts, how they work and why they are important in a diesel engine.
After this initial approach, meetings with the client, and meetings with the marketing team
I was ready to start planning.</p> 

<p class="red"><strong>Step 1: Gathering information</strong></p> 

<ol> <li><p>Market research: competitors, diesel concept, potential clients.</p></li> 
<li><p>Client background: 15 years of experience in the market, family-owned business, 
  heavy duty diesel parts, New, OEM and Remanufactured parts, diesel technicians 
  remanufacturing the parts with specific equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Targeting the audience: What they do, what they consume, which 
states do they live in, what are their ages, do they have 
trucks? are they diesel technicians? are they diesel truckers? are they 
employees? are they diesel truck owners?</p></li> 
</ol> 
<li><p>Checking competitors: Where do they sell? Do they have a digital 
presence? What channels do they use to advertise online? Do they use Inbound 
or Outbound Marketing? What are their differentials with my client? </p></li> 
</ol> 


<p class="red"><strong>Step 2: Marketing Basic Concepts</strong></p> 

<ol> <li><p>Brand identity: create a concept to develop a logo, colors, 
motto, etc. </p> 

<p class="red">I decided that diesel parts buyers needed bold bright 
colors, that won't only capture their attention but that it will 
resonate with them, evoking the primary colors used on their trucks 
</p></li>

<li><p>Graphic identity: develop a graphic identity in different visual 
marketing materials for: social media, website, banners (digital and 
physical), printing materials, etc.</p></li> 

<p class="red"><strong>Step 3: Marketing Basic Concepts</strong></p> 
  
<h1>Contacting potential clients</h1>
<h1>Assesing the campaign</h1>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Give me your tired, your poor,
Your worn out diesel parts yearning to breath free,
The polluted air of your teeming shore.
Send them, storm tossed by parcel post to me,
I will clean them up inside the golden door!</p>
