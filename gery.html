<h1> Project 1: DTIS Online </h1>

<p><img id="pic1" src="slider-dtis.png"></p> 

<p>Brand and identity development is an essential process for shaping 
how a <b>company</b> is perceived by its target audience. In DTIS 
Online's case, I was involved as a project manager and marketing 
coordinator for it's development in an <i>international</i> market such 
as the one in the United States. </p> 


<h2>Initial Approach</h2> 

<p>Our client was struggling, they had no sales, they didn't know what 
to do, they were losing sales and customers. When I was giving this 
project I was horrified with Diesel, because it's nasty, disgusting, 
filthy stuff. Then there was me, without any involment with diesel, 
thinking that I wanted to maintain my clean manicure, horrofied about 
the idea of Diesel compleately, because it would pollute our planet. 
</p> 

<p>Later I met DTIS Online's owner, he was very nice and attentive, he 
said I was right, that diesel is a very nasty, that if we do want to 
use, we must burned it, as cleanly, and as efficiently as possible, and 
this cannot be done unless its diesel injectors are in perfect 
condition. He explained he was on a mission to clean up the atmosphere 
by cleaning out the nation's diesel parts. I was shocked, surprised, 
amazed by this explanation, I saw the light, I realized how I wanted to 
help with his mission, I then applied my skills to this project.</p> 

<p class="red"><strong>Step 1: Gathering information</strong></p> 

<ol> <li><p>Market research: competitors, diesel concept, 
potential clients.</p></li> 

<li><p>Targeting the audience: What they do, what they consume, which 
states do they live, what are their ages, do they have 
trucks? are they diesel technitians? are they diesel truckers? are they 
employees? are they diesel truck owners?</p></li> 
</ol> 

<p class="red"><strong>Step 2: Marketing Basic Concepts</strong></p> 

<ol> <li><p>Brand identity: create a concept to develop a logo, colors, 
motto, etc. </p> 

<p class="red">I decided that diesel parts buyers needed bold bright 
colors, that won't only capture their attention but that it will 
resonate with them, evoking the primary colors used on their trucks 
</p></li>

<li><p>Graphic identity: develop a graphic identity in different visual 
marketing materials for: social media, website, banners (digital and 
physical), printing materials, etc.</p></li> 


<h1>Contacting potential clients</h1>
<h1>Assesing the campaign</h1>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Give me your tired, your poor,
Your worn out diesel parts yearning to breath free,
The polluted air of your teeming shore.
Send them, storm tossed by parcel post to me,
I will clean them up inside the golden door!</p>
